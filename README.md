- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Zack109
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Vibe coding random IT troubleshooting Tools that I think would cool or useful, like a windows registry file comparison tool that takes 2 registry files, compares them and gives you the result with an export button. So you can like backup the entire registry, install an application, export it again and see what the app added to the registry.
