Registry File Comparison Tool
A lightweight, browser-based utility to compare two Windows Registry export (.reg) files and highlight the differences. Ideal for understanding what changes an application installer or update makes to the registry.

Features
Side-by-Side Comparison: Easily upload a "before" and an "after" .reg file.

Detailed Difference Highlighting: Clearly visualizes added, deleted, and modified registry keys and values.

Handles Large Files: Built to process large .reg files (200MB+) without freezing the browser by parsing and comparing the data in incremental chunks.

Progress Indicators: Shows real-time progress for file parsing and comparison operations.

Export to HTML: Save a standalone, styled HTML report of the comparison results to share with others.

Client-Side Processing: All files are processed directly in your browser. No data is ever uploaded to a server, ensuring privacy and security.
